# Title: Order form


## The goal
The goal of this exercise is to create an order form.  
I did not have to create everything in this exercise myself. Only the processing of the data.
the goal of this exercise was to learn how $_COOKIE, $_SESSION,$_GET and $_POST operates.
This exercise is made during my studies at BeCode.




## The result
This was a fun exercise, I learned a lot while interacting with $_COOKIE, $_SESSION,$_GET and $_POST.
It was interesting to see how they can interact with each other.

The main thing I don't like about the result is that I'm still using for loops instead of foreach.
This and other syntax improvements that have to be made.
